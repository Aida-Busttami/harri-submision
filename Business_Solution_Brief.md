# Business Solution Brief: Harri Dev Team AI Assistant

## The Problem
Developers waste 20-30% of their time searching for information instead of coding. Daily routine: check Jira → ask Slack → dig through docs → still not find answers. This costs like having 1 in 4 developers just doing research.

## Who Benefits
**Engineers**: Get instant answers about processes, team info, project status. **Team Leads**: Stop getting interrupted with basic questions. **New Hires**: Onboard faster without feeling lost. **Managers**: See happier teams and faster delivery.

## Business Impact
**Immediate**: 2-3 hours saved per developer per week. **Long-term**: Happier developers, faster delivery, better decisions, reduced knowledge silos.

## How It Works
**Before**: Open Jira → search tickets → check Slack → ask team lead → wait → still unsure. **After**: Type question → get instant answer with sources → back to coding.

## Competitive Advantage
Unlike generic solutions, this assistant understands your specific context, combines multiple data sources, provides transparent sourcing, and improves over time.
